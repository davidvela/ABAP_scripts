## course summary: 
Customers want to exchange business data between their **SAP S/4HANA** Cloud and other SAP and non-SAP systems in their enterprise or at their trading partners via business-to-business. In particular, they want to create and enable the required integration content for exchanging the data as soon as possible. The problem is that all these systems/applications have **different, heterogeneous domain models**, meaning the effort required to integrate them is always high when using the classic integration tools. To overcome this, the Integration Advisor capability of SAP Integration Suite (short: Integration Advisor) unifies all the necessary components, with a strong focus on usability, understandability, reusability, flexibility, transparency, and speed based on a **comprehensive knowledge base** and **machine learning**.

In this course, you’ll learn how you can use the completely new paradigm provided by the Integration Advisor to quickly define, maintain, share, and deploy integration content to SAP Integration Suite Cloud Integration. You’ll learn how to create **functional interface definitions and mapping guidelines**, which will then be automatically generated and enabled in SAP Integration Suite Cloud Integration in order to build end-to-end integration scenarios between SAP S/4HANA and external A2A/B2B systems.
