# u2 - Adapting an app as a key user
1. Remove the "Availability" header element
2. Remove the sections "Sales Data" and "Notes", as they are not relevant for your users
3. Rename the "Inventory Information" section to "Inventory" for brevity
4. Reviews are more important to your users than technical information, hence "Reviews" should be shown first
5. The "Technical Data" section should show a new field, "Supplier"
6. The "Base Unit" field should be removed from the "Technical Data" section
7. Add "Quantity" to the table contained in "Inventory" and put it to the left of "Ordered Quantity"
8. Add an Iframe as a section to include the CurrencyConverter located at https://themoneyconverter.com/MoneyConverter?from=USD&amp;to=EUR&amp;amount=XXX where XXX is to be replaced by the product’s price. The Iframe should be 180 pixels wide and 220 pixels in height. Name the new section "Price (EUR)" and move it to the first position.

# u3 - Adapting the UI as a developer – basic extensions
1. Remove the options button
2. Change the column title from Category to Type
3. Enlarge the product image in the single object view.
